# reimannsumcalc
Simple Reimann Sum Calculator for Java

This project contains two Java Files, a reimannSum class and the main class. In order to calculate a Riemann sum, a user would have to edit the equation method in the reimannSum class and then enter the values as prompted when running the main. The main gets a starting value of X, ending value of X, and the delta X value from the user. Then, the Reimann Sum is returned.
